// Conditional Logic - Logical Operators

var budget = 300;
var iPhonePrice = 199.99;
var paycheck = 200;

//if the price of the phone is less than our budget AND if our paycheck is over 300
//if(iPhonePrice < budget){
//	console.log("We can buy the phone!");
//}else{
//	console.log("No phone for you!!");
//}

//if(paycheck > 300){
//	console.log("We can buy the phone!");
//}else{
//		console.log("No phone for you!!");
//}

//problem with using these two ifs... you get two messages and two conflicting messages.
//Now the problem is to combine the two conditional statements

if(iPhonePrice < budget && paycheck > 300){
	console.log("We can buy the phone!");
}else{
	console.log("No phone for you!!");
}
